MV --> Minimize Vulnerability
ME --> Maximize Efficiency

FL ---> max of added links is fixed
TC ---> continue till the graph is connected after attack. 


1. Minimize Vulnerability Estimate (MVE):
	- First order the possible combinations (between highest betweenness in each group)
	- in each step of adding a link we make sure that vulnerability decreases.
	
2. Minimize Vulnerability Estimate2(MVE2):
	- First order the possible combinations (between highest betweenness in each group)
	- in each step of adding a link we make sure that if added to graph it will not be romved in the updated attack.
	
3. Not increasing Vulnerability & maximizing efficiency after attack (KVME)

	- Get all the combinations
	- remove the ones who increase vulnerability
	- choose the link which maximazies the efficiency

4. Only maximizing efficiency (ME) -----same result as 
- Get all the combinations
	- remove the ones who increase vulnerability
	- choose the link which maximazies the efficiency after attack
